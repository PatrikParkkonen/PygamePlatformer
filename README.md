# PygamePlatformer

Simple platforming game made using Pygame, following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ongc4EVqRjo &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Level editor is from https://github.com/russs123/Platformer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Assets are either made by me or from https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-art-deluxe and https://freesound.org/

The game contains 7 stages, and the goal is to reach the end. There's a slightly different ending if you collect all 35 hearts.

There are some minor bugs with the moving platforms pushing the player through other objects, but otherwise the game functions normally.
